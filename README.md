My Idea was to come up with an App/Business concept, and build an App Landing Page showcasing the app, its features and how to download it.

## Product Development
To help me create something that looked real, I went through the process of developing the idea behind this product, some of the details can be seen below.
## Concept
Bookdrops tackles one of the emerging issues born with the coronavirus quarantine - people with spare time in their hands. <br>
We see this is a unique opportunity to take on a new hobby, learn something new or dive deeper into something. Good books are key to that.

We offer a subscription program that delivers books to the user‚Äôs address every month. The selection is based on the user‚Äôs interests ‚Äì be it fictional such as romances or non-fictional such as history or self-help books. <br>
Recommendations take into consideration best-sellers, community reviews and even books read and  liked by the user. <br>
There is also an important social aspect to Bookdrops ‚Äì each user has their own bookshelf ‚Äì public or private, users can post and read reviews, join discussion groups, follow other users, earn badges and become a specialist in each topic. 

## Why, How and What

- Why ‚Äì What is our cause, purpose or belief:
    - We want to expand your horizon, teach you new things, and inspire you into inspiring others. Help you access your untapped potential.
- How ‚Äì The steps to make the Why a reality:
    - By bringing the library to the palm of your hand. Reading is the gateway to future better self.

- What ‚Äì What we do, what is our product:

## Design
### Colour Scheme
-   For this project, the color palette was created with the help of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/885db1-c4a6e2-1f1f1f-ffffff-f5f5f5).
-   I specifically aimed for shades of Purple as the main colors due it being frequently associated with knowledge, imagination and wisdom, which are desired attributes for this brand.
-   White, whitesmoke and Eerie black were used to improve the readability of the page - these are also very common colors among tech projects.<br>

### Typography
-   To make the logo, instead of using an Image as usual, I opted for an actual font - this would make resizing and working with the logo in general much easier.
-   Logo font is [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito), from Google Fonts. This is an easy to read font and while the conventional choice would be a "serif" type font for the logo, I opted for a modern and joyous-looking one to make people aware that this is an innovative project.
-   All remaining content is presented using [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=I%20love%20reading!&preview.text_type=custom) - Also from Google, that as described by [justinmind.com](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/best-google-web-fonts-website/), is an "attractive, geometric sans-serif font for use in text or display contexts"

### Images
-   To create the App images I used the free iPhone and iPad frames available on [invisionapp.com](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-resources/clay-device-mockup-kit/).
-   The App Mockups were created by myself using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html?sdid=88X75SKS&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0d5iteD9mDfwbVY5_zxo4G1ioeCjslpMQ38zeDxEL1WdMDsP8enAQSxoCYb8QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!474049279825!e!!g!!photoshop!1423511192!58810496314&gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0d5iteD9mDfwbVY5_zxo4G1ioeCjslpMQ38zeDxEL1WdMDsP8enAQSxoCYb8QAvD_BwE).
-   Bookdrops App UI was heavily inspired on [Netflix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en_IE)'s Android UI as the main goal was to make it look real, something that brought familiarity to the users.
-   The icons used in the App UI, as well as the ones used in the Features section of the website were created by [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.local) - these were used as in a way of complementing the message. 
-   As written by [Nijolaj Mertz](https://usabilla.com/blog/how-and-why-icons-improve-you-web-design/#:~:text=Icons%20can%20be%20a%20great,together%20with%20more%20descriptive%20text.) :

    > "Icons can be a great way to bring essential content to the point. They are a great attention grabber and they help your website visitors to find and scan content."
